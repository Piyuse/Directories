Network Topologies

•Network Topology is the pattern used to arrange the nodes of network (describe the way computers are connected).
•Basic topologies: bus, ring, star, mesh, hybrid

1. Bus Topology

oSimplest

odesigned in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable(known as a backbone cable)

oAdvantages: low cost cable, moderate data speed, limited failure

oDisadvantages : reconfiguration is difficult, signal interference, extensive cabling**Network Topologies**

1. **Bus Topology**

•A single cable connects all the devices in the network
•The cable is called the bus
•The bus is a shared medium
•All the devices on the bus can communicate with each other
•If one device is down, the entire network is down

2. **Ring Topology**

•All computers are connected in a closed loop
•Each node connects to exactly two other nodes, creating a circular network structure.
•One broken device can disable entire network

3. **Star Topology**

•All the devices are connected to a single hub
•This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node
•Failure of central hub will make the entire network collapse
•Cost of installation is high4. Mesh Topology
• Computers are interconnected with each other
• There are multiple paths from one computer to another
• Internet is an example of mesh topology
• 2 types – fully connected and partially connected (certain computers are connected) mesh topology
5. Hybrid Topology
• Combination of various different topologies
• Two or more topologies are combined together
• Advantages: reliable, flexible, effective
• Disadvantages: complex design , costly infrastructure

Transmission modes 
Communication between 2 devices can be
- Simplex
- full-duplex
- half-duplex

In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can
transmit; the other can only receive. Ex: keyboard, monitor

In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When one device is sending,
the other can only receive, and vice versa. Ex: walkie-talkies

In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive at same time ie, simultaneously. Ex : telephone networkNetwork Software
Protocol
In computer networks, communication occurs between entities in different systems. An entity is anything capable of
sending or receiving information. However, two entities cannot simply send bit streams to each other and expect to be
understood. For communication to occur, the entities must agree on a protocol.

A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications.

A protocol defines what is communicated, how it is communicated, and when it is communicated.

The key elements of a protocol are:

1. Syntax (format or structure of data blocks)
2. Semantics (it refers to the meaning of each section of data bits. How are a specified pattern to be interpreted; and what
action is to be taken based on that interpretation
3. Timing (when data should be sent, how fast they can be sent)

For More Study Materials: https://www.keralanotes.com/Protocol Hierarchies: - Layered architecture

To reduce their design complexity, most networks are organized as a stack of layers or levels, each one built upon the one below it.

The number of layers, the name of each layer, the contents of each layer, and the function of each layer differ from network to network.

Basically, a protocol is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed.

The purpose of each layer is to offer certain services to the higher layers while shielding those layers from the details of how the offered services are actually implemented.

Each layer is offering certain services to the layer above it.

In a layer n architecture, layer n on one machine carries on a conversation with layer n on another machine, and the rules and conventions used in this conversation are collectively known as the layer n protocol.

Lets take an example of the five layered architecture

A five-layer network is illustrated in Fig. 

For More Study Materials: https://www.keralanotes.com/• In reality, no data are directly transferred from layer n on one machine to layer n on another machine. Instead,
each layer passes data and control information to the layer immediately below it, until the lowest layer is
reached. i.e., The data and information is passed by each layer to the lower layer.
• When the lower layer is reached it is passed to the physical medium
• Below layer 1 is the physical medium through which actual communication occurs.
• Between each pair of adjacent layers tis an interface . The interface defines which type of operations and
services t the lower layer offers to the upper layer.
• Protocols are together called protocol stack or set of protocols And a set of layers and protocols is called
network architecture.• A message, M, is produced by an application process running in layer 5 and given to layer 4 for transmission. Layer 4
puts a header in front of the message to identify the message and passes the result to layer 3. The header includes
control information such as addresses, to allow layer 4 on the destination machine to deliver the message.
• Consequently, layer 3 must break up the incoming messages into smaller units, packets, prepending a layer 3 header
to each packet. In this example, Mis split into two parts, M1and M2, that will be transmitted separately. Layer 3
decides which of the outgoing lines to use and passes the packets to layer 2. Layer 2 adds to each piece not only a
header but also a trailer, and gives the resulting unit to layer 1 for physical transmission.
• At the receiving machine the message moves upward, from layer to layer, with headers being stripped off as itprogresses. None of the headers for layers below nare passed up to layer n.
• header & trailer includes control information, such as s equence numbers, sizes, times, and other control fields

10. Confidentiality and Integrity**Connection-Oriented Versus Connectionless Service**

Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them:

* **Connection-oriented**
* **Connectionless**

1. **Connection-oriented service**

* This service follows a sequence of operations:
    * Establish a connection
    * Data transfer
    * Terminate the connection

* To talk to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number, talk, and then hang up. Similarly, to use a connection-
oriented network service, the service user first establishes a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the
connection. In some cases when a connection is established, the sender, receiver conduct a negotiation about the
parameters to be used, such as maximum message size, quality of service required, and other issues. Typically, one side
makes a proposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or make a counter-proposal.

* Here, data arrive in the order they were sent.
* This is a reliable service.

2. **Connectionless service**

* No connection Establishment
* Unreliable (meaning not acknowledged) connectionless service
* Does not return an acknowledgement to the sender.
* Normally, when two messages are sent to the same destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive.
However, it is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives first.
* There is no guarantee.
* The order in which messages are sent and arrived can be different. ‰ OSI Reference Model
‰ TCP/IP Reference Model

Reference Models (network architectures)

For More Study Materials: https://www.keralanotes.com/OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection
Designed by the International Standards Organization (ISO)
The model is called the ISO-OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model
(Because it deals with connecting open systems—that is, systems that are open for communication with other systems.)
It has seven layers: OSI Reference Model

Name of unit exchanged
PDU- protocol data unit
APDU- application PDU
PPDU- Presentation PDU3. Network Layer

The network layer is responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of a packet.

At this layer, the unit of data exchanged among nodes is typically called a packet.

Network layer ensures that each packet gets from its point of origin to its final destination.

Other responsibilities of the network layer includes routing and Logical addressing.

Logical addressing: The physical addressing implemented by the data link layer handles the addressing problem
locally. If a packet passes the network boundary, we need another addressing system to help distinguish the source
and destination systems. The network layer adds a header to the packet coming from the upper layer that, among
other things, includes the logical addresses of the sender and receiver.

Routing : When there are multiple paths between source and destination, only one route must be chosen.

4. Transport Layer

Here, the unit of data exchanged is TPDU.

The transport layer is responsible for process-to-process delivery of the entire message.

Other responsibilities:

* Connection control: The transport layer can be either connectionless or connection oriented. (A connection oriented
transport layer makes a connection with the transport layer at the destination machine first before delivering the
packets. After all the data are transferred, the connection is terminated.)
* Protocols used :TCP-Transmission control protocol (connection oriented)
UDP-user datagram protocol (connectionless)
* Segmentation and reassembly: A message is divided into transmittable se gments, with each segment containing a
sequence number. These numbers enable the transport layer to reassemble the message correctly upon arriving at the
destination and to identify and replace packets that were lost in transmission.
* Flow control
* Error control5. Session Layer

It establishes, maintains, and synchronizes the interaction among communicating systems.

Session layer is responsible for dialog control and synchronization.

Specific responsibilities of the session layer includes:

- Dialog control. The session layer allows two systems to enter into a dialog. It allows the communication
between two processes to take place in either half duplex (one way at a time) or full-duplex (two ways at a
time) mode.

- Synchronization. The session layer allows a proc ess to add checkpoints(inspect any packet), or
synchronization points, to a stream of data.

6. Presentation Layer

presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between two
systems .

Specific responsibilities of the presentation layer includes: the

- Translation (exchanging information the form of character strings, numbers, and so on. The
presentation layer at the sender changes the info rmation from its sender-dependent format into a
common format. The presentation layer at the receiving machine changes the common format into its
receiver-dependent format )

- Encryption : (ensure privacy) (sender transforms the original information to another form and sends
the resulting message out over the network. Decryption reverses the original process to transform the
message back to its original form)

- compression :Data compression reduces the number of bits contained in the information. Data
compression becomes particularly important in the transmission of multimedia such as text, audio, and
video**Application Layer**

* Provide services to users
* application layer enables the user, whether human or software, to access the network. It provides user
interfaces and support for services such as electronic mail, remote file access and transfer, shared
database management, and other types of distributed information services.
* Specific services provided:
    * File transfer, access, and management : This application allows a user to access files (to make changes or
read data), to retrieve files , and to manage or control files.
    * Mail services: This application provides the basis for e-mail forwarding and storage
    * Directory services : This application provides distributed database sources and access for global
information about various objects and services.
* Protocols used : FTP , SMTP , HTTP etc1. Host-to-Network Layer

* host-to-network layer is equivalent to the combination of the physical and data link layers
* The TCP/IP reference model does not really say much about what happens here, except to point out that the host
has to connect to the network using some protocol so it can send IP packets to it. This protocol is not defined and
varies from host to host and network to network.
* The 4 layers of TCP/Model are: host-to-network, internet, transport, and application layer

2. Internet Layer

* Internet layer defines an official packet format and protocol called IP (Internet Protocol).
* The internet layer is equivalent to the network layer.
* The job of the internet layer is to deliver IP packets where they are supposed to go.
* Packet routing & avoiding congestion are the major issue here.
* For these reasons, it is reasonable to say that the TCP/IP internet layer is similar in functionality to the OSI
network layer
* uses four supporting protocols:
ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
RARP -Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
ICMP -Internet Control Message Protocol
IGMP -Internet Group Message Protocol3. Transport Layer 
•UDP and TCP are transport level protocols responsible for delivery of a message from a process (running
program) to another process.
oTCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
oUDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
•A new transport layer protocol, SCTP , has been devised to meet the needs of some newer applications.
oStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
4. Application Layer
•Provide services to users
•contains all the higher-level protocols like
file transfer (FTP)
electronic mail (SMTP)
Domain Name System (DNS)
Terminal network (TELNET)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)Protocols and networks in the TCP/IP model

More complexity due to more number of
layers Less complexity due to less number of
layersTransmission Media
A transmission medium can be defined as anything that can carry information from a source to a destination.
Guided media
•Guided media, which are those that provide a conduit from one device to another, include twisted-pair cable, coaxial
cable, and fiber-optic cable.
1. Twisted-Pair Cable
•A twisted pair consists of two conductors (normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together
•One of the wires is used to carry signals to the receiver, and the other is used only as a ground reference• Why to twist the wires?
Twisting of wires will reduce the effect of noise or external interference.
The number of twists per unit length will determine the quality of cable.
More twists means better quality
• 2 types: a) Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable (STP)
b) Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable (UTP)
• UTP:
The most common twisted-pair cable used in communications
Very cheap
Easy to install
Badly affected by the noise interference
• STP:
STP cable has a metal foil or braided mesh to cover each pair of insulating conductors. This is known as metal shield.It
reduces the interference of the noise
metal casing improves the quality of cable by preventing the penetration of noise or crosstalk
it is bulkier
more expensive
For More Study Materials : https://www.keralanotes.com/**2. Twisted-Pair Cable**

Twisted-pair cable consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. It is the most common type of cable used for
telephone and computer networks.

* Applications:
    * In point to point and point to multipoint communications
    * Telephone systems
    * Local-area networks, such as l0Base-T and l00Base-T, also use twisted-pair cables.
    * in telephone lines to provide voice and data channels.

In twisted pair, in addition to the signal sent by the sender on one of the wires, interference (noise)and crosstalk may affect
both wires and create unwanted signals. If the two wires are parallel, the effect of these unwanted signals is not the same inboth wires because they are at different locations relative to th e noise or crosstalk sources. This results in a difference at the
receiver. By twisting the pairs, a balance is maintained. Twisting makes it probable that both wires are equally affected by
external influences (noise or crosstalk). The number of twist s per unit of length has some effect on the quality of the cable.

**2. Coaxial Cable**

Coaxial cable (or coax) carries signals of higher frequency ranges than those in twisted pair cable.

* Coaxial cable has a central core conductor of solid or stranded wire (usu ally copper) enclosed in an insulating sheath, which is, in
turn, encased in an outer conductor of metal foil, braid, or a combination of the two.
* The outer metallic wrapping serves both as a shield against noise and as the second conductor, which completes the
circuit.
* This outer conductor is also enclosed in an insulating sheath, and the whole cable is protected by a plastic cover**Cable**

* Coaxial cable
  * Categorized by their radio government (RG) ratings
  * Need coaxial connectors to connect to devices
  * Costlier than twisted-pair cable
  * Excellent noise immunity
  * Cheaper than optical fiber cables
  * Large bandwidth and low losses
* Twisted-pair cable
  * Less expensive than coaxial cable
  * More susceptible to noise than coaxial cable
  * Used in telephone networks and Ethernet LANs
* Optical fiber
  * Accepts and transports signals in the form of light
  * Made of glass or plastic
  * Consists of an inner glass core surrounded by a glass cladding which has lower refractive index
  * Uses reflection to guide light through a channel
  * Light is launched into the fiber using a light source such as light emitting diode(LED) Or laser
  * A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic
  * Costlier than other 2 types
  * Advantages:
    * Higher bandwidth
    * Less signal attenuation
    * Immunity to electromagnetic interference. (Electrom agnetic noise cannot affect fiber-optic cables.)
    * Resistance to corrosive materials (Glass is more resistant to corrosive materials than copper.)
    * Light weight (Fiber-optic cables a re much lighter than copper cables.)
    * Greater immunity to tapping. (Fiber-optic cables are more immune to tapping than copper cables. Copper cables create
      antenna effects that can easily be tapped.)Disadvantages:
- Installation and maintenance.
- Unidirectional light propagation.
- Cost.
Applications:
- Fiber-optic cable is often found in backbone networks
- Telephone systems
- Some cable TV companies use a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable,thus creating a hybrid network.
- Local-area networks (such as 100Base-FX network (Fast Ethernet) and 1000Base-X also use fiber-optic cable)
Unguided media
- Unguided media transport electromagnet ic waves without using a physical conductor
- Signals are normally broadcast through free space and thus are available to anyone who has a device capable of
receiving them.**Electromagnetic Waves**

Electromagnetic waves are a type of wave that consists of an electric field and a magnetic field that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of travel of the wave. Electromagnetic waves are produced by the acceleration of charged particles, and they can travel through a vacuum.

**Types of Electromagnetic Waves**

There are many different types of electromagnetic waves, each with its own unique properties. Some of the most common types of electromagnetic waves include:

* **Radio waves:** Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and the lowest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves. They are used for communication, broadcasting, and navigation.
* **Microwaves:** Microwaves have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than radio waves. They are used for cooking, radar, and telecommunications.
* **Infrared:** Infrared waves have even shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than microwaves. They are used for heat sensing, night vision, and remote controls.
* **Visible light:** Visible light is the type of electromagnetic radiation that we can see with our eyes. It has wavelengths that range from about 400 to 700 nanometers.
* **Ultraviolet:** Ultraviolet waves have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than visible light. They are used for tanning, disinfection, and medical imaging.
* **X-rays:** X-rays have even shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than ultraviolet waves. They are used for medical imaging, security screening, and industrial inspection.
* **Gamma rays:** Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves. They are produced by nuclear reactions and are used for medical treatment and cancer research.

* **Other applications:** Electromagnetic waves are also used for a variety of other applications, including weather forecasting, remote sensing, and telecommunications.Performance indicators
1. Bandwidth
• The data carrying capacity of the network or transmission media
• The Max channel capacity to transmit data
• The Volume of data transmitted at a particular time
• The term can be used in two different contexts with two different measuring values:
    * bandwidth in hertz
    * bandwidth in bits per second.
• bandwidth in hertz, refers to the range of frequencies in a composite signal or the range of frequencies that a channel
can pass.
• For example, we can say the bandwidth of a subscriber telephone line is 4 kHz.
2. Throughput
• The measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network.
• At first glance, bandwidth in bits per second and throughput seem the same, but they are different. The bandwidth is
a potential measurement of a link; the throughput is an actual measurement of how fast we can send data.
• bandwidth in bits per second, refers to the speed of bit transmission in a channel or link.ie, the number of bits per
second that a channel, a link, or even a network can transmit.
• For example, one can say the bandwidth of a Fast Ethernet network (or the links in this network) is a maximum
of 100 Mbps. This means that this network can send 100 Mbps.
• an increase in bandwidth in hertz means an increase in bandwidth in bits per second. The relationship depends on
whether we have baseband transmission or transmission with modulationQueuing Time
The third component in latency is the queuing time, the time needed for each intermediate or end device to hold the message before it can be processed.
The queuing time is not a fixed factor; it changes with the load imposed on the network.
When there is heavy traffic on the network, the queuing time increases. An intermediate device, such as a router, queues the arrived messages and processes them one by one. If there are many messages, each message will have to wait.
Bandwidth-Delay Product
Bandwidth and delay are two performance metrics of a link. what is very important in data communications is the product of the two, the bandwidth-delay product.
The bandwidth-delay product defines the number of bits that can fill the link.
